# [Covid-19 Short Overview]

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

# [Covid-19 Short Prevention]

To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following: 

1. Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.
2. Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.
3. Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.
4. Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
5. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.
6. Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
7. If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.
